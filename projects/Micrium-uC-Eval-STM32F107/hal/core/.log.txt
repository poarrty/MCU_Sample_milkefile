Detach a process or file previously attached.
If a process, it is no longer traced, and it continues its execution.  If
you were debugging a file, the file is closed and gdb no longer accesses it.

List of detach subcommands:

detach inferiors -- Detach from inferior ID (or list of IDS).

Type "help detach" followed by detach subcommand name for full documentation.
Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word".
Type "apropos -v word" for full documentation of commands related to "word".
Command name abbreviations are allowed if unambiguous.
run, r
Start debugged program.
You may specify arguments to give it.
Args may include "*", or "[...]"; they are expanded using the
shell that will start the program (specified by the "$SHELL" environment
variable).  Input and output redirection with ">", "<", or ">>"
are also allowed.

With no arguments, uses arguments last specified (with "run" or 
"set args").  To cancel previous arguments and run with no arguments,
use "set args" without arguments.

To start the inferior without using a shell, use "set startup-with-shell off".
step, s
Step program until it reaches a different source line.
Usage: step [N]
Argument N means step N times (or till program stops for another reason).
stepi, si
Step one instruction exactly.
Usage: stepi [N]
Argument N means step N times (or till program stops for another reason).
next, n
Step program, proceeding through subroutine calls.
Usage: next [N]
Unlike "step", if the current source line calls a subroutine,
this command does not enter the subroutine, but instead steps over
the call, in effect treating it as a single source line.
nexti, ni
Step one instruction, but proceed through subroutine calls.
Usage: nexti [N]
Argument N means step N times (or till program stops for another reason).
until, u
Execute until past the current line or past a LOCATION.
Execute until the program reaches a source line greater than the current
or a specified location (same args as break command) within the current frame.
finish, fin
Execute until selected stack frame returns.
Usage: finish
Upon return, the value returned is printed and put in the value history.
continue, fg, c
Continue program being debugged, after signal or breakpoint.
Usage: continue [N]
If proceeding from breakpoint, a number N may be used as an argument,
which means to set the ignore count of that breakpoint to N - 1 (so that
the breakpoint won't break until the Nth time it is reached).

If non-stop mode is enabled, continue only the current thread,
otherwise all the threads in the program are continued.  To 
continue all stopped threads in non-stop mode, use the -a option.
Specifying -a and an ignore count simultaneously is an error.
Continue program with the specified signal.
Usage: signal SIGNAL
The SIGNAL argument is processed the same as the handle command.

An argument of "0" means continue the program without sending it a signal.
This is useful in cases where the program stopped because of a signal,
and you want to resume the program while discarding the signal.

In a multi-threaded program the signal is delivered to, or discarded from,
the current thread only.
Kill execution of program being debugged.

List of kill subcommands:

kill inferiors -- Kill inferior ID (or list of IDs).

Type "help kill" followed by kill subcommand name for full documentation.
Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word".
Type "apropos -v word" for full documentation of commands related to "word".
Command name abbreviations are allowed if unambiguous.
Select and print stack frame that called this one.
An argument says how many frames up to go.
down, dow, do
Select and print stack frame called by this one.
An argument says how many frames down to go.
The program being debugged is not being run.

Start debugged program.

This is useful in cases where the program stopped because of a signal,
and you want to resume the program while discarding the signal.
